how to format the excel document into the proper format:
-copy the column(s) you want into a new sheet
-create new cells inbetween each column and after the last column
-in the top cell of the column, put your value seperator (I used a comma. In hindsight I should have used something less common) and apply that cell to all the cells in that column 
-in a cell next to the right of the last column type "=(<firstCell> & <secondCell> & <thirdCell>...)" and hit enter
	this should combine the columns into one column with the value seperator seperating the values
-copy this new column into a new sheet, paste the values paste>values (for me this was the one with the clipboard and 123 on it)
	this should paste the column with the data instead of a #REF! or something like that
-select the column to the right of the data column and click up top on Formulas>Text>CLEAN
-select the top column of your data column and select ok
	this new right entry no longer has a bunch of whitespace that will ruin shit
-apply this to the rest of the column
	the right data column is your new best friend
-copy this new column into a new sheet (again use paste>values)
	this sheet now is formatted correctly
-select up top File>Save As>Save as Type>Text (Tab delimited)
-close the excel workbook
-open the text file you just made
-ctrl+H
-find what: <your value seperator>
-replace with: _<value seperator>_	where _ = <space>
-your text document should look exactly like: (using a comma as a value seperator for example)
	<productName> , <brandName> , <organic> , <UPC> , 
-if some entries in your spreadsheet were blank when you formatted it it will look like:
	<productName> , <brandName>,  , <organic> , <UPC> , 
	that's fine, I did another ctrl+H and replaced: ,  , with: , <none> ,
-Pain in the ass? yes. Worth it? maybe. Are you done? probably.


-cases that ruin shit (using a comma as a seperator)
	- Strawberries , Apples and Blueberries , <brandName> , <organic> , <UPC> , 	<- the comma between Strawberries and Apples 
	- <productName> , Monsters, Inc. , <organic> , <UPC> , 				<- the comma between Monsters and Inc.
	- litteraly any other cases that aren't exactly the proper format

-other notes
	- organic returns 0 if the product is not organic, 1 if it is, and -1 if that cell was empty or if there was an error
	- whitespaces are the devil
	- one error reading in a value can cause cascadaing input errors. go to the first instance of the error and fix it there and try it again.
	- there are multiple UPCs that are 00000000 so it might return a the wrong entry in those cases
good luck

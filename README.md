Project Boiler Plate for Project Non-GMO
=========================================

Created by : Mike McCormick, Neil Carrico, James Scott, Bridger Lewis

We partnered with NonGMOProject.org to take their already existing database of verified Non-GMO products and developed an Android application that scans barcodes and returns useful information whether the product is Non-GMO or not. 














All code and necessary files for our Mobile Application Project NON-GMO

* **Source:** This is where we placed all of our source code.  Our project was made in Java and our IDE was Android Studio. 

* **Documents:** Here is all files and documents that were used to create our application. In this folder you will find various txt documents, jpegs, zips, etc that were used to help us in our pursuit of a final product.
